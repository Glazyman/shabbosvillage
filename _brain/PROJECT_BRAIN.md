# Shabbos Village — Project Brain

> **Rule:** After every Claude session that makes changes, append an entry to the [Session Log](#session-log) at the bottom of this file. One entry per session, no matter how small the change. Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>` followed by bullet points of what changed and why.

---

## Deployment Notes

**Always force push.** Normal `git push origin main` consistently fails with diverged remote errors due to a persistent local/remote state mismatch. Use:

```
git push --force origin main
```

This is a solo repo with no other contributors, so force pushing is safe. Vercel auto-deploys from the `main` branch on GitHub after every push.

## What Is This Project

**Shabbos Village** is a campground booking website for a Jewish outdoor Shabbos experience — tent camping in a wooded setting with creek access, communal atmosphere, and Shabbos-specific amenities. The site handles discovery, booking, waiver signing, and event confirmation.

- **Live site:** shabbosvillage.com
- **Deploy:** Vercel (auto-deploy from `main` branch)
- **Repo:** /Users/glazy/Desktop/Shabbosvillage

## Amenities (current homepage strip)

Tent Camping · Electric Hookups · Showers & Toilets · Creek Access · Nature Trails · Communal Gathering · Family Friendly · Water Stations · Motzei Shabbos Food Court

---

## Wording to Lock In

- Motzei Shabbos heading: **"When Shabbos ends, the fun continues."** (not "begins")

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **Waiver signed at checkout**, not on a standalone page (removed standalone signature form)
- **Navbar:** hamburger-only on mobile, full link bar on desktop
- **Mobile footer:** 2-column layout, "On Site" column hidden to save space
- **Amenity strip:** horizontal scroll on mobile (no wrap) with `scrollbarWidth: none`
- **Logo:** candle/lantern icon (`/logo.png`, updated 2026-05-29); also `logo 2.png` in public
- **Fonts aliased** — `--font-playfair` is actually Lora; `--font-dm-sans` is actually Josefin Sans (kept alias names from original design)
- **Images:** Unsplash URLs (no local photos yet)
- **Directions:** not shown publicly — sent after booking only

## Session Log

### 2026-05-27 — Initial build

- Created full Next.js 14 site from scratch (initial commit from Create Next App)
- Added vercel.json to set framework explicitly for Vercel detection
- Fixed Stripe lazy-load to avoid build-time crash without env vars

### 2026-05-28 — Full redesign + features

- Redesigned homepage — real Unsplash photos, editorial layout (removed emoji boxes)
- Redesigned all pages — camping editorial style, Lora/Josefin fonts, tent logo
- Redesigned booking page and hamburger menu to match editorial style
- Added gallery page
- Added inline waiver signing in checkout flow; gallery added to nav
- Wired mobile responsive layout — CSS classes added to all page components
- Fixed mobile layout; added Resend email notifications on booking confirmation
- Cleaned up mobile menu — compact links, overflow scroll, full-width CTA

- Fixed booking step indicators
- Compact mobile footer: 2-col links, "On Site" column hidden on mobile
- Fixed rules page section headers — clamped number size, cleaner dividers

### 2026-05-29 — Logo update

- Updated logo to new candle lantern design (`logo.png` replaced)

### 2026-05-31 — Amenities expansion

- Added "Food Storage Station" and "Motzei Shabbos Food Court" to amenity strip on homepage

### 2026-06-01 — Brain, minyonim, navbar, amenities grid, dropdowns

- Created `_brain/PROJECT_BRAIN.md` and added session-log rule to `CLAUDE.md`
- Added "6 Minyonim Within Walking Distance" to homepage amenity strip
- Added minyonim as item 08 in About page "What to Expect" list
- Restored `Navbar.tsx` (had been accidentally deleted from working tree)
- Added "Shabbos Village" text next to logo in Navbar (matches footer style; color transitions with scroll state)
- Footer logo: shrunk from 88×88px square to 30×45px lantern with inline brand name text
- Amenity strip: switched from `nowrap`/horizontal-scroll to `flexWrap: wrap` so it fits naturally at any width
- Added full "What's Included" amenities grid section to homepage (3-col desktop, 2-col tablet, 1-col mobile) — 9 cards numbered in gold, placed after editorial intro
- Added Motzei Shabbos food court split section to homepage (later removed, see below)
- Fixed heading: "When Shabbos ends, the fun **continues**" (not "begins") — locked in brain
- Replaced inline amenities grid with `AmenitiesGrid` client component (`app/components/AmenitiesGrid.tsx`) so cards can be interactive
- "Motzei Shabbos Chill" card is expandable — click to reveal full food court details inline; `+` rotates to `×` when open
- Removed the standalone Motzei Shabbos split section (content now lives in the dropdown)
- All pushes use `git push --force origin main` due to persistent local/remote state mismatch

### 2026-06-15 — New lamp logo (transparent)

- Replaced `public/logo.png` with new lamp + "Shabbos Village" design (sourced from a ChatGPT-generated image)
- Made the cream background transparent via edge flood-fill (PIL/scipy) so the warm glow inside the lantern is preserved
- Navbar (`Navbar.tsx:61`) and Footer (`Footer.tsx:13`) both reference `/logo.png`, so both update automatically
- Note: navbar renders logo at 60×60px; baked-in "SHABBOS VILLAGE" text reads small at that size — may want a lamp-only crop for the navbar later
- `public/logo 2.png` remains unused (not referenced anywhere)
- Enlarged logo: Navbar 60→96px (nav height bumped 80→112px / scrolled 64→88px to avoid clipping); Footer 160→220px
- Footer logo fix: transparent logo showed cream blobs in letter counters (B/O/A/G holes) on the dark footer. Made `public/logo-footer.png` with footer green `#1a2a0f` baked in (global cream→green replace, feathered edges) so it blends seamlessly. Footer now uses `/logo-footer.png`; navbar still uses transparent `/logo.png`

### 2026-06-18 — Content edits, packing-list PDF, legal waiver rewrite

- **About page** — item 07 "Food storage station": "shared trailer" → "shared space". Item 08 "6 minyonim": removed the "no need to drive" wording, added "you're always welcome to make your own minyan as well."
- **Homepage AmenitiesGrid** — item 02 "Motzei Shabbos Chill": dropped the on-site food court; desc now just "Late-night hangout once Shabbos is out." Dropdown `extra` stripped of all food (pizza/bakery/sushi) — now only highlights the volleyball/communal hangout chill.
- **FAQ** — #1: "XL cabin-tent sites" → "XL tent sites" (tents only). #3: removed the "$20/night" electricity price (TBD) → "for an additional fee". #8: added a **Download Packing List (PDF)** button; `faqs` array now typed with optional `download: {href,label}` and the answer block renders a green download link when present.
- **Packing list PDF** — created `public/shabbos-village-packing-list.pdf` (branded, 7 sections w/ checkboxes, 114 KB, valid PDF). Generated via reportlab (installed with `pip3 install --user`, NOT added to package.json); reusable generator kept at `_brain/renders/make_packing_list.py`.
- **Hold Harmless waiver** (`app/waiver/page.tsx`) — full rewrite into a comprehensive 12-section legal agreement. Released/indemnified party is now **Joseph Farkas, individually and d/b/a Shabbos Village** (not the entity), via a defined "Released Parties" term. Governing law: **New York** (confirmed w/ user). Intro + acknowledgement note updated. Inline checkout waiver summary (`app/book/page.tsx:287`) updated to match the Joseph Farkas release language.
- Note: `npx tsc --noEmit` reports two pre-existing TS2688 errors for stray `node_modules/@types/react 2` and `react-dom 2` duplicate folders (Finder/iCloud " 2" duplication, same pattern as `logo 2.png`) — unrelated to these edits; all edited files typecheck clean.
